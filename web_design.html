    <h1>Web Design</h1>
    <p>A web designer works on the appearance, layout, and, in some cases, content of a website. Appearance, for instance, relates to the colors, font, and images used. Layout refers to how information is structured and categorized. A good web design is easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and suits the user group and brand of the website. Many webpages are designed with a focus on simplicity, so that no extraneous information and functionality that might distract or confuse users appears. As the keystone of a web designerâ€™s output is a site that wins and fosters the trust of the target audience, removing as many potential points of user frustration as possible is a critical consideration.</p>
